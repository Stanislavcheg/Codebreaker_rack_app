				<p>	It's a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6. The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers. The game then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs.
				A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position. 
				A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.</p>
